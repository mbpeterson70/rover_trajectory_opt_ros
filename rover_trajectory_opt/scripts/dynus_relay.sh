# # In general, it is will not be the rXYZ yaw Euler angle of the UAV (unless the drone is in a hover condition).
# # This is due to the fact that q_psi (see link above) already has some rXYZ yaw on it.

# # Trajectory tracking mode for x/y and z components.
# # The default is POSITION control, which uses position and velocity error
# # to calculate the control effort. VELOCITY control only uses vel error.
# # ACCELERATION mode does not use tracking error and could be used to provide
# # a control signal computed from something other than the default PID cntrl.
